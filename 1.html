<h2>What is Valorant?</h2>
<img src="Valorant.webp" width="25%">
<p style="margin-top:25px;"><strong><a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/"target="_blank" title="official Valorant homepage">Valorant</a></strong> is a 2020 <strong><u>tactical hero shooter video game</u></strong> developed and published by Riot Games. <strong>A free-to-play game</strong>, Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving. Development started in 2014 and was teased under the codename Project A in 2019; the game was released on June 2, 2020 for Windows. It was ported to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in June 2024, albeit without crossplay between PC and console clients.</p>
<h2>Agent</h2>
Before entering the first round, player enter Agent Select. Here you’ll pick from a group of 24 Agents currently, all divided into four different roles based on their functionality. You'll notice that you won't have all the Agents unlocked with a new account. But the more you play, the faster you'll be able to unlock them!
<p style="margin-top:35px;">Each Agent has their own unique set of skills designed to work alongside each other toward a win. While it’s not mandatory to have each role in your team of five, you’ll discover that you have a higher chance of winning when your team has a more diverse Agent pool where each player has a specific duty. For example, it’ll be easier to get onto a site if you have a Controller who can smoke the sight lines enemies might be watching!</p></body></html>
