<h2>Agent</h2>
Before entering the first round, player enter Agent Select. Here you’ll pick from a group of 24 Agents currently, all divided into four different roles based on their functionality. You'll notice that you won't have all the Agents unlocked with a new account. But the more you play, the faster you'll be able to unlock them!
<p style="margin-top:35px;">Each Agent has their own unique set of skills designed to work alongside each other toward a win. While it’s not mandatory to have each role in your team of five, you’ll discover that you have a higher chance of winning when your team has a more diverse Agent pool where each player has a specific duty. For example, it’ll be easier to get onto a site if you have a Controller who can smoke the sight lines enemies might be watching!</p></body></html>
